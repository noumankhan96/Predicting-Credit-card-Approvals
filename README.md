# Predicting-Credit-card-Approvals
**The project is about to create an app which can either accept or reject the application for the credit card as it was manual and hectic process so through this project we can automate it with the help of Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We have use multiple libraries to make it as good predcitor as it can along with some changes in the dataset like fixing the missing value etc. Although there was not any Visual Analysis in it but still by seeing dataset in dataframe can help us make a better concept of how the things are working. We have done preprocessing and rescalling of the data in this project. At last we get the result having 85% of accuracy**.

# Required Libraries for the project
- Pandas
- Numpy
- scikit-learn

# How to run the project
- First unzip the dataset into C drive user folder
- Then Copy the .ipynb file into Jupyter Notebook
